- ocr/

  Just doing OCR as a true fairseq task, not quite complete (as of 2020-07-31).

- pretrain/

  Trains models

  - aligned/:
    - pretrain_aligned.sh: Just doing OCR training of the embeddings.
    - extract_aligned: Loads the model from above, generates images on train/dev/test data for use later.
      Saves the images.
  - unaligned/: [same]

- vistrans/
  - aligned/
    - train_vismt_add.sh: loads checkpoint from pretraining, freezes it, then runs translation. Adds embeddings.
    - train_vismt_{avg,concat}: same, but does averaging or concatenating
    - train_vismt_visonly.sh: loads from pretrained, but doesn't combine with tokens

    They do go through the same code, just flip a switch based on whether the OCR checkpoint is loaded.
